			<p class="col-span-2 text-xl font-medium text-base-5">Background</p>
			<p class="col-span-5 text-xl font-medium">
				Over the past decade, I’ve worked across consumer products, B2B platforms, and agentic AI
				systems. I currently lead design and frontend at Origon, building AI-native software used in
				real operational environments.

			<p class="col-span-2 text-xl font-medium text-base-5">Approach</p>
			<p class="col-span-5 text-xl font-medium">
				I focus on long-lived systems—interfaces that scale in complexity without losing clarity,
				and frontend architectures built to last. I prefer owning problems end to end, from early
				product definition to shipped code, and collaborate selectively on a small number of
				freelance projects.

			<p class="col-span-2 text-xl font-medium text-base-5">Perspective</p>
			<p class="col-span-5 text-xl font-medium">
				I care deeply about clarity, restraint, and craft. I value thinking through problems before
				reaching for solutions, and I’m drawn to work that rewards patience, curiosity, and
				long-term responsibility over short-term outcomes.
